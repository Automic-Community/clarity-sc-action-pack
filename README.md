###### Description

CA Service Catalog helps you expose service offerings where, when and how they are needed, whether mobile or in portals. Thanks to CA Service Catalog, end-userscan request IT on non-IT services to be fulfilled.
Automic Service Orchestration automates any technical or business workflow. Thanks to its many integrations with infrastructure providers and applications, Automic can execute all the IT operations necessary to fulfill a service request.
By integrating CA Service Catalog with Automic, you can provide self-service offerings that will be fully automated. IT teams will have more time to spend on tasks that provide higher-value to the enterprise, and end-users will gain time by having services delivered super-fast.
This Action Pack for CA Service Catalog (to be loaded into Automic), allows workflow designers to let automation workflows inform end-users about the progress of their service requests.
See also: The CA Service Catalog Plugin to load in CA Service Catalog. It allows service catalog designers to create service request forms that trigger Automic workflows.
